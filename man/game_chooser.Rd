\description{
This app uses a board game collection (as downloaded from
\href{https://boardgamegeek.com}{boardgamegeek.com} to help a user choose a game to play based on the
number of players, the time available, and/or the age of the youngest
player. There's also a random game selector if you're really indecisive!
